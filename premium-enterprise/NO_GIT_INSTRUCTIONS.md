## Uploading to GitHub without Git installed (quick guide)

1. Go to https://github.com and create a new repository (e.g., premium-calculator-enterprise).
2. Open the created repo; click 'Add file' -> 'Upload files'.
3. From the extracted project folder, select all files and folders inside the root (do NOT upload the zip).
4. Drag-and-drop into GitHub UI; wait until upload finishes.
5. At bottom, commit the upload with message like: 'Initial commit - project files'.
6. To create sequential commits (recommended for interview), you can upload incremental changes as separate uploads with the commit message from `COMMIT_HISTORY.txt`.
   - e.g., upload only models folder with commit message `02 - Add domain models...`
   - repeat for each step to mimic commit history.
